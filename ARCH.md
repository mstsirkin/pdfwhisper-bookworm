# On-device JavaScript Architecture (iPhone + Android)

Goal: Run an end-to-end pipeline in JavaScript on mobile (iPhone + Android) that:
1) renders a PDF page → PNG image,
2) converts each page image → text via OpenAI (vision),
3) converts text → compressed audio via OpenAI TTS,
4) outputs one audio file per page (AAC) and bundles everything into one ZIP for sharing (e.g., WhatsApp).

This design intentionally avoids on-device re-encoding tools (no ffmpeg, no wasm audio encoders).

## 1. High-level flow

Input: PDF (local file)

Per page:
- Render PDF page to canvas (PDF.js)
- Encode canvas to PNG image blob
- Send image to OpenAI → get text
- Send text to OpenAI TTS (`aac`)
- Produce `page_###.txt` + `page_###.aac`

Output:
- ZIP of all pages
- Optional full concatenated AAC

## 2. Runtime targets

- Capacitor (recommended)
- React Native
- Safari Web App

## 3. PDF rendering

Use PDF.js.

Rules:
- Page jobs can run in parallel (bounded by `maxParallel`)
- Default scale: `2` (user-editable)
- Always output PNG
- Free canvas after each page

## 4. Vision prompt (single-step)

Tools allowed for image cleanup only.

Transcription rules:
- Visual inspection only
- Remove headers/footers
- Inline footnotes:
  FOOTNOTE: [ ... ] END OF FOOTNOTE
- JSON only:
  { "file": "..." }

Default prompt (user-resettable):

You may use tools only to improve image quality (crop margins, deskew/rotate, denoise, increase contrast/sharpness).
Do not use any OCR, text-extraction, PDF text layer, or “extract text” tool.
After any cleanup, transcribe the text by visual inspection of the page image, in correct reading order.
Remove repeating page headers and footers.
If there is a footnote, insert it inline exactly as:
FOOTNOTE: [ ... ] END OF FOOTNOTE
Output JSON only with exactly:
{ "file": "<full page text>" }

## 5. TTS

- response_format: "aac"
- One AAC per page

## 6. ZIP bundling

JSZip:
- audio/page_###.aac
- text/page_###.txt
- manifest.json

## 7. WhatsApp

Send ZIP as document.
Large ZIPs supported.

## 8. Memory

- Page-by-page processing
- Optional volume ZIPs

## 9. Modules

pdf/renderPage.ts  
openai/visionToText.ts  
openai/textToAac.ts  
packaging/zipBundle.ts  
pipeline/runPipeline.ts  

## 10. Interfaces

Render → PNG Blob  
Vision → string  
TTS → Uint8Array  
ZIP → Blob  

## 11. Defaults

PNG rendering  
AAC output  
Per-page naming default: `page_###`  
Optional non-persistent `Name` prefix: `Name_page_###`  
Full output naming: `Name.ext` when `Name` is set, else `full.ext`  

## 12. Constraints

No audio transcoding.
AAC bitrate uncontrolled.

## 13. UX core

- App title: **PDF Whisper: Speak Low If You Speak**
- Numbered control rows:
  - `1)` OpenAI API key
  - `2)` Upload PDF
  - `3)` Execution settings toggle
  - `4)` Start processing / Cancel / Restart only failed jobs
  - `5)` Download actions
- Row `2)` includes compact inline controls:
  - file picker
  - **Name** (non-persistent)
  - **From page** (optional, non-persistent)
  - **To page** (optional, non-persistent)
- On file selection, `Name` auto-fills from filename without `.pdf`.
- If `From/To` are blank, processing defaults to first and last page.
- API key field (persisted locally) with helper links:
  - Creating keys
  - Add to balance
- Execution settings are collapsible (Show settings / Hide settings), collapsed by default.
- Prompt editor (persisted) is inside execution settings.
- Button: **Reset all settings** (keeps API key, resets prompt + execution defaults).
- Per-page slots + progress
- Restart per page
- Restart only failed jobs (global action, enabled when any page is failed)

## 14. UX additions (per-page immediacy)

Artifacts appear immediately.

Per page:
- TXT downloadable as soon as vision finishes
- AAC downloadable as soon as TTS finishes

Stages:
queued → rendering → vision/vision(try:X) → text_ready → tts/tts(try:X) → ready

Also possible terminal states:
failed, cancelled

Global:

- When all TXT ready:
  Enable “Download all TXT (ZIP)”

- When all AAC ready:
  Enable:
   - “Download all AAC (ZIP)”
   - “Download full concatenated AAC”

- Download row shows a status emoji after `5)`:
  - Not started: `🧘😴`
  - Working: `👷‍♂⏳`
  - Done with failures: `🤷😘`
  - Ready: `👍😘`

Concatenated AAC = byte-append ADTS pages.

Download naming behavior:
- Per-page TXT/AAC:
  - `Name_page_###.txt/.aac` when `Name` is set
  - `page_###.txt/.aac` when `Name` is empty
- ZIP downloads:
  - `Name_text_pages.zip` / `Name_aac_pages.zip` when `Name` is set
  - `text_pages.zip` / `aac_pages.zip` when `Name` is empty
- Full outputs:
  - `Name.txt` / `Name.aac` when `Name` is set
  - `full.txt` / `full.aac` when `Name` is empty

Cancel:
- Stops new pages
- Aborts in-flight
- Keeps completed results

Persistence:
- OpenAI key (secure storage)
- Prompt
- Voice/model/settings (including scale, max parallel, and request stagger seconds)
- `Name` / `From page` / `To page` are intentionally non-persistent.

UX summary:
- Immediate per-page TXT
- Immediate per-page AAC
- Reset-all-settings button (API key preserved)
- Final buttons gated by readiness
- No waiting for full document


## 15. Vision model + prompt (current defaults)

Vision model:

- `gpt-4o-mini` (current default in `app.html`)

Default PNG → text prompt:

look at this page from a paper, taking into account that papers can use varying indent and fonts for emphasis, and remove repeating page headers and footers (but leave title in place), and note if there are footnotes and where they are referenced. IF TEXT IS HARD TO READ THINK HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND EXTRACT IT. make sure not to remove paper text! if you are in doubt whether something is a header or main text, it is better to leave it in place.  then, produce the text of the page.
if there is a footnote, find where the footnote belongs (the place where the footnote is referenced by number!) and insert inline like this:
<insert space here>FOOTNOTE: [ TEXT ] END OF FOOTNOTE .
To be clear: for example, if text has reference [1] and foot note stating 1. SOMETEXT at bottom of page, replace [1] with
 FOOTNOTE: [ SOMETEXT ] END OF FOOTNOTE and completely exclude 1. SOMETEXT at the end of the file.

Do not use OCR do it manually!
return the result in field "file" in json.
Do not add any additional comments besides the markup above. in particular leave any notes outside of the file field in json.

This prompt is persisted locally and can be edited by the user.
A “Reset all settings” action restores this prompt and other execution defaults while keeping the API key.


## 16. Running as a single HTML file (JS inline)

The app is designed to run as a **single standalone HTML file** with all JavaScript embedded inline.

Structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script>
  // entire app logic pasted here
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Usage:

1. Put the full app JS inside a normal inline `<script>`.
2. App lazy-loads PDF.js + JSZip from CDN with fallback (jsDelivr → unpkg).
3. Open the file directly in a modern browser (Safari / Chrome / Edge).
PDF worker behavior:

- App first attempts PDF.js worker mode.
- If browser throws:
  `Refused to cross-origin redirects of the top-level worker script`
  app retries automatically with `disableWorker: true`.

If you still want stricter local-origin behavior under `file://`, run a tiny local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/app.html
```

No build step.
No backend.
Everything runs locally except OpenAI API calls.



## 17. Full concatenated text download

In addition to per-page TXT downloads, the UI must provide:

- **Download full concatenated TXT**

Behavior:

- As soon as **all text pages** are ready:
  - Enable a button: “Download full concatenated TXT”
- The combined file is created by concatenating all `page_###.txt` contents in page order,
  separated by two newlines between pages.
- Output filename:
  - if `Name` is set: `Name.txt`
  - if `Name` is empty: `full.txt`

This is independent of audio readiness and appears together with:

- “Download all TXT (ZIP)”

Summary:

- Per-page TXT → immediate
- Full concatenated TXT → when all text pages complete


## 18. Parallel page processing

The pipeline supports **parallel processing of pages** to improve throughput.

### User control

Add a numeric input:

- **Max parallel pages** (concurrency limit)
- Default: **30**
- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: user-defined (practically constrained by device memory and API limits)
- UI label: **Max parallel pages (0 to start jobs manually)**
- Additional pacing input:
  - **Request stagger (seconds)**
  - Default: **1**
  - `0` disables pacing
  - This setting can be edited mid-run
- Retry toggle:
  - **Retry on rate limit (HTTP 495)**
  - Default: enabled
  - When disabled, HTTP `495` fails the page immediately (no auto-retry)

This value controls how many pages may be simultaneously in-flight (render → vision → TTS).

### Behavior

- Pages are queued in order.
- If `N > 0`: at most **N** pages run concurrently.
- If `N = 0`: pages are queued but no jobs auto-start.
- When `N > 0`, as soon as one page finishes or fails, the next queued page starts.
- Per-page UI updates independently.
- In manual mode (`N = 0`), user starts jobs page-by-page via **Restart Page**.
- OpenAI requests are globally staggered by configured seconds.
- Stagger is enforced between sends and completions (next request waits after either event).

### UX

- Field appears in the `3)` execution settings panel (opened via “Show settings”):

  “Max parallel pages (0 to start jobs manually): [ 30 ]”

- Changing **max parallel pages** affects the next Start (not mid-run).
- Changing **request stagger (seconds)** applies to subsequent requests immediately (including mid-run).

### Cancellation

- Cancel aborts all in-flight pages immediately.
- Queued pages are never started.
- Completed pages remain downloadable.

### Rationale

- Default 30 provides strong throughput on modern desktops.
- User may reduce to 1 for low-memory devices or increase for fast desktops.
- `0` enables manual per-page start workflows.


## 19. Rate-limit resilience (current behavior)

Current status in `app.html`:

- Scheduler uses user-selected fixed concurrency (`maxParallel`).
- Global request staggering is implemented via `requestStaggerSec` (default `1`).
- Vision/TTS calls retry indefinitely on HTTP `495` until:
  - success, or
  - user cancels, or
  - page restart is requested.
- Retry-on-`495` behavior is user-configurable via settings toggle:
  - enabled: keep retrying with `try:X` counter
  - disabled: fail immediately on first `495`
- During HTTP `495` retries, page stage shows:
  - `vision(try:X)` or `tts(try:X)` (incrementing `X`)
- The latest HTTP `495` error message is shown in page error/status so user can monitor and cancel.
- Adaptive HTTP `429` backoff is **not implemented yet**.



## 20. Per-page restart (full page)

Each page row in the UI includes an additional action:

- **Restart Page**

### Behavior

For a given page:

1. Discard any existing:
   - extracted text
   - generated AAC
2. Reset page state (clear text/audio/error for that page).
3. Re-run full pipeline:

- Render (PDF → PNG)
- Vision (PNG → text)
- TTS (text → AAC)

### UX

Per page buttons:

- Download TXT (when ready)
- Download AAC (when ready)
- **Restart Page**

Restart button is disabled only while a restart is already pending for that page.

### Interaction with concurrency

- Restarted pages are managed by the same scheduler pool.
- If page is already running:
  - restart marks pending
  - aborts in-flight request(s)
  - immediately starts a fresh run for that same page.
- If page is queued or idle while pipeline is running:
  - restart starts it immediately, even if this temporarily exceeds `maxParallel`.

### Rationale

Allows quick recovery from:

- bad transcription
- prompt changes
- temporary vision failures

without restarting the entire document.



### Clarification

“Restart Page” means a **full restart of that page**:

Render (PDF → PNG) → Vision → TTS

Nothing is skipped or reused. Each restart regenerates a fresh PNG and re-runs all steps.

### Global failed-page restart

There is also a global action:

- **Restart only failed jobs**

Behavior:

- Enabled only when one or more pages are in `failed` state.
- Resets and restarts only failed pages.
- Uses the same scheduler and concurrency settings as the main pipeline.



## 21. Vision model input + automatic temperature detection

### Vision model selection

UI currently uses a **free-text model field** (persisted locally), e.g.:

- `gpt-4o-mini`
- codex-family IDs (if available to the API key)

The app does not currently pre-load model IDs from `/v1/models`.

### Temperature capability detection

OpenAI does **not** expose a reliable capability flag indicating whether a model supports `temperature`.

Therefore the app uses **probe + fallback**:

1. First vision request is attempted with:

```
temperature: 0
```

2. If the API returns an error matching:

- HTTP 400
- message contains “temperature” and “not supported / unsupported / unknown”

then:

3. The request is immediately retried **without `temperature`**.

4. Result is cached locally:

```
temp_supported::<model_id> = true | false
```

5. Future requests for that model automatically include or omit `temperature`
based on this cache.

### Rationale

- Codex-style models reject sampling parameters.
- General models accept them.
- This adaptive approach:

  - requires no hardcoded model lists
  - works across future models
  - avoids user-visible failures
  - converges after a single probe

### Summary

- Vision model entered via persisted text field
- Temperature support detected dynamically per model
- Decision cached locally
- Vision calls become self-correcting and future-proof


## 22. Future ideas

The following items were previously described as active behavior but are now tracked as future enhancements.

### Vision model dropdown from `/v1/models`

Possible implementation:

- Call `GET /v1/models` using the user API key.
- Filter returned IDs to relevant vision-capable model families.
- Populate a `<select>` dropdown instead of free-text input.
- Persist selected model ID locally.

Expected benefit:

- Fewer invalid-model errors.
- Better discoverability of models available to each user key.

### Adaptive concurrency backoff on 429

Possible implementation:

- Keep user `maxParallel` as an upper bound.
- Track runtime `effectiveParallel`.
- On HTTP 429:
  - reduce `effectiveParallel` (e.g., multiplicative decrease),
  - re-queue failed page with jittered retry delay.
- After sustained success:
  - slowly increase `effectiveParallel` (additive increase).
- Clamp automatic backoff floor to `1` so manual mode (`maxParallel = 0`) remains user-controlled.

Expected benefit:

- Better throughput under changing rate limits.
- Fewer hard failures at high concurrency settings.

### Cost estimate UI

Possible implementation:

- Track per-page estimated token/audio usage and aggregate total.
- Clearly label values as estimates.
- Provide reset action for the local cost counter.
- Show per-page estimate in page table and overall estimate in header.


## 23. TODO: Apple Books-friendly M4B output (on-device)

Goal:

- Add optional M4B export with chapter navigation for Apple Books.
- Keep existing TXT/AAC/ZIP flows unchanged.
- Keep processing fully on-device.

Current constraints discovered:

- Mediabunny does not currently expose direct chapter authoring APIs.
- Mediabunny does not currently expose a public way to inject `tref/chap` references.
- A fork/patch is required for complete Apple Books chapter wiring.

Decisions:

- Keep one high-level app path only (no public low-level "power user" API).
- Keep any low-level MP4 box work internal to the fork.
- Keep app delivery as a single HTML file; vendored patched Mediabunny is bundled into `app.html`.
- Derive chapter timing from generated per-page AAC data (no OpenAI timing dependency).

Implementation TODO:

- [ ] Add an on-demand "Download M4B (chapters)" action.
- [ ] Parse each per-page AAC duration via Mediabunny input track timing.
- [ ] Build cumulative chapter start times from page durations.
- [ ] Concatenate page AAC into one audiobook audio track.
- [ ] Create and mux a chapter text track payload (format to be finalized during implementation).
- [ ] Add `tref/chap` track reference from main audio track to chapter track.
- [ ] Mark chapter track as non-default/hidden for playback.
- [ ] Write output filename as:
  - `Name.m4b` when `Name` is set
  - `full.m4b` when `Name` is empty
- [ ] Validate behavior in Apple Books on iPhone with real multi-page samples.

Non-goals for this phase:

- Do not introduce server-side muxing.
- Do not expose raw MP4 internals in app UI/settings.
